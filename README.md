* :blond_haired_man:	

Regarding my technical skills, I'm proficient in Java and knowledgeable in PHP, C++, and MySQL. Additionally, I've undertaken frontend projects utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using frameworks such as Node.js, Bootstrap, and SASS.

My journey with Java has been enriching. I've dedicated significant time to mastering its fundamentals and exploring its diverse frameworks and libraries, such as JavaFX, JUnit, and Spring.

Currently, I'm working on a CRUD application with the goal of deepening my knowledge of the Spring Framework and JUnit.

If you wish to get in contact with me for any possible opportunities, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-melo/">LinkedIn</a> is a great way to get in touch!
