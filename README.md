My journey with Java has been enriching. I've dedicated significant time to mastering its fundamentals and exploring its diverse frameworks and libraries, such as JavaFX, JUnit, and Spring.

Currently, I'm working on a CRUD application with the goal of deepening my knowledge of the Spring Framework and JUnit.
